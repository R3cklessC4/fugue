# Welcome to Fugue!
# To get started we first need to talk about stacks and reverse hungarian notation (don't worry its not that bad).
# This language is a bit funkier than your average programming language, and one of the main ways this manifests is in how
# mathematical expressions are written

# Most programming languages use "infix" expressions, meaning that if you want to add 3 to 2 you write "3 + 2".
# Fugue uses "postfix" (tahts the hungarian stuff),    meaning that if you want to add 3 to 2 you write "3 2 +".

# This is where the stacks come in, lets take a look at the above example and what the Fugue interpeter will do
# when it encounters each of the symbols in "3 2 +"
# 3 -> push 3 onto the "register stack"                             ==> stack is now [3]
# 2 -> push 2 onto the "register stack"                             ==> stack is now [3, 2]
# + -> consume the top two elements on the stack and push their sum ==> stack is now [5]


# We will explain the register stack in more detail in the next tutorial, but for now just think of it as your local
# variables you work with when doing math and stuff.

# The main function will provide a you with a number at the top of your regiser stack and your task is to print:
# Double that number plus 12
# For example: if the task was to add two to the input number we would just have to write "2 +" because there is already a number
# On the stack
# Hint: you can consume and print the top of the stack with the puti word (i.e "3 puti" would print 3)
