    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <p>
        WASM or Web assembly is a low level binary instruction format that is 
        dsigned to be a portable target for compelation of high level laungauges.

        Our programming lanagauge Fugue is complied into wasm. This involes transforming the source code into a binary format ('.wasm') which is compact 
        and fast to transmit,parse, and execute. 

        The WebAssembly module (.wasm file) is loaded by a web application through HTML/JavaScript. 
        This file can be fetched from a server just like other assets such as images or scripts.

        Once the module is loaded, it is instantiated in the browser. During instantiation, the WebAssembly code is compiled and optimized by the browser's JavaScript engine
        into executable machine code.This process is much quicker than JavaScript interpretation because WebAssembly is already in a low-level, machine-friendly format.

        Once instantiated and integrated, the WebAssembly code runs at speeds close to native machine code performance. This is especially beneficial for heavy computational 
        tasks like image processing, games, or complex algorithms.

        WebAssembly maintains a high level of security by executing code in a sandboxed environment. 
        This means it has limited access to the system it's running on, much like JavaScript.
